# Data Science in Education using R
Analyzing and visualizing educational data using R.

## Source 
The following code files were created by following the [Data Science in Education using R](https://datascienceineducation.com/) book. 

## Details
### 1. [Foundational Skills](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/06_foundation_skills.R)
This data exploration covered the concepts of Projects, functions, packages, and data, along with the foundational ideas, concepts, and skills related to doing data science in R. 

### 2. [Online Science Class Data](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/07_online_science_class_data.R)
- Worked on taking unprocessed or raw data to load, view, and process it through a series of stpes. 
- Created a basic regressional model to find that the time that students spent on the course was positively (and statistically significantly) related to students’ final grades, and that there appeared to be differences by subject.

### 3. [Approaching Gradebook Data](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/08_gradebook_data.R)
- Imported, cleaned, and transfored data. 
- Explored the data using data visualization before modeling the data using linear regression.
- Used [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to share and communicate the analysis results to others 

### 4. [School Level Aggregate Data to Illuminate Educational Inequities](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/09_educational_inequalities.R)
In this data exploration, I discovered the following results: 
- There exists a distribution of race/ethnicity within schools that are not representative of the district.
- Students of color are overrepresented in high poverty schools.
- There is a negative relationship between the percentage of White students in a school and the percentage of students eligible for FRPL.

### 5. [Longitudinal Analysis with Federal Students with Disabilities](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/10_federal_students_with_disabilities.R)
In this data exploration, I narrowed down to focus on the five states with the highest counts of students with disabilities. I made the following discoveries:
- Each state has a different count of students with disabilities–so different that we need to use statistics like ratios or visualizations to compare across states.
- All five states have increased their counts for students with disabilities. 

### 5. [Text Analysis with Social Media Data](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/11_SNS_sentiment_analysis.R)
In this data exploration, I practiced basic text analysis techniques.

### 6. [Exploring Relationships Using Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/12_SNS_social_network.R)
In this data exploration, I collected twitter posts using the #tidytuesday hashtag to visualize social network data. I used Sociograms to visualize which user is interacting with whom.

### 7. [Multilevel Models](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/13_multilevel_models.R)

### 8. [Predicting Students’ Final Grades Using Machine Learning Methods](https://github.com/seyoung02227/Education-Data-Science/blob/main/14_ML_predict_grade.R)
In this data exploration, I was introduced to general machine learning ideas, such as training and test datasets, how random forest works, and how to tune specific parameters so that the model is as effective as possible at predicting an outcome.
